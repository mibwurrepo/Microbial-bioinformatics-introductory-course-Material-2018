# Alpha diversities  

Alpha diversity measures are used to identify within individual taxa richness and evenness. The commonly used metrics/indices are Shannon, Inverse Simpson, Simpson, Gini, Observed and Chao1. These indices do not take into account the phylogeny of the taxa identified in sequencing. Phylogenetic diversity (Faith's PD) uses phylogenetic distance to calculate the diversity of a given sample.   

*It is important to note that, alpha diversity indices are sensitive to noise that is inherent to application of polymerase chain reaction and the  sequencing errors.*  

One has to consider the sequencing depth (how much of the taxa have been sampled) for each sample. If there is a large difference, then it is important to normalize the samples to equal sampling depth. First we look at the sampling depth (no. of reads per sample)   

**Load packages**  
 


```r
library(microbiome) # data analysis and visualisation
library(phyloseq) # also the basis of data object. Data analysis and visualisation
library(microbiomeutilities) # some utility tools 
library(RColorBrewer) # nice color options
library(ggpubr) # publication quality figures, based on ggplot2
library(DT) # interactive tables in html and markdown
library(data.table) # alternative to data.frame
library(dplyr) # data handling  
```

The data for tutorial is stored as *.rds file in the R project folder.  

We will use the filtered phyloseq object from **Set-up and Pre-processing** section.  


```r
ps1 <- readRDS("./phyobjects/ps1.rds")


# use print option to see the data saved as phyloseq object.

print(ps1)
```

```
## phyloseq-class experiment-level object
## otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 3690 taxa and 474 samples ]
## sample_data() Sample Data:       [ 474 samples by 31 sample variables ]
## tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 3690 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ]
## phy_tree()    Phylogenetic Tree: [ 3690 tips and 3689 internal nodes ]
```



```r
summary(sample_sums(ps1))
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    1286    3063    4192    5060    5790   41694
```

As is evident there is a large difference in the number of reads. Minimum is 1286 and maximum is 41694!! There is a ~30X difference!  

We can plot the rarefaction curve for the observed OTUs in the entire data set.  


```r
out_tab <- t(abundances(ps1))
p <- vegan::rarecurve(out_tab, 
                      step = 50, label = FALSE, 
                      sample = min(rowSums(out_tab), 
                                   col = "blue", cex = 0.6))
```

Not all samples are reaching a plateau and that few samples have high number of reads and high number of OTUs.  
Since we are comparing different body sites, some are expected to have low bacterial load.  
We will normalize to the lowest depth of at least 2000 reads to keep maximum samples for our anlaysis. This can be varied to remove samples with lower sequencing depth. This decision will depend on the research question being addressed.  

## Equal sample sums  


```r
set.seed(9242)  # This will help in reprodcuing the filtering and nomalisation. 

ps0.rar <- rarefy_even_depth(ps1, sample.size = 2000)
```

```
## You set `rngseed` to FALSE. Make sure you've set & recorded
##  the random seed of your session for reproducibility.
## See `?set.seed`
```

```
## ...
```

```
## 12 samples removedbecause they contained fewer reads than `sample.size`.
```

```
## Up to first five removed samples are:

## 688OTUs were removed because they are no longer

```

```
## ...
```

```r
saveRDS(ps0.rar, "./phyobjects/ps0.rar.rds")
```

Check how much data you have now  


```r
ps0.rar <- readRDS("./phyobjects/ps0.rar.rds")


print(ps0.rar)
```

```
## phyloseq-class experiment-level object
## otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 3002 taxa and 462 samples ]
## sample_data() Sample Data:       [ 462 samples by 31 sample variables ]
## tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 3002 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ]
## phy_tree()    Phylogenetic Tree: [ 3002 tips and 3001 internal nodes ]
```



```r
 # quick check for sampling depth

barplot(sample_sums(ps0.rar), las =2)
```

<img src="03-MAW-PII_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />



```r
# quick check taxa prevalence

p.rar <- plot_taxa_prevalence(ps0.rar, "Phylum")

p.rar
```

<img src="03-MAW-PII_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" />



Compare this to taxa prevalence plot from previous section of the tutorial.  

Do you see any difference?

Let use calculate diversity

### Phylogenetic diversity   

Phylogenetic diversity is calculated using the `picante` package.  


```r
library(picante)

ps0.rar.otutab <- as.data.frame(ps0.rar@otu_table)

ps0.rar.tree <- ps0.rar@phy_tree

# hmp.meta from previous code chunks

# We first need to check if the tree is rooted or not 

ps0.rar@phy_tree
```

```
## 
## Phylogenetic tree with 3002 tips and 3001 internal nodes.
## 
## Tip labels:
## 	4440970, 627481, 86812, 4442127, 4394095, 32546, ...
## Node labels:
## 	, , , , , , ...
## 
## Rooted; includes branch lengths.
```

```r
df.pd <- pd(t(ps0.rar.otutab), ps0.rar.tree,include.root=T) # t(ou_table) transposes the table for use in picante and the tre file comes from the first code chunck we used to read tree file (see making a phyloseq object section).


datatable(df.pd)

**NOTE:**  

There are arguments both for and against the use of rarefying to equal library size.  
The application of normalization method will depend on the type of research question. It is always good to check if there is a correlation between increasing library sizes and richness. Observed OTUs and Phylogenetic diversity can be affected by library sizes. It is always good to check for this before making a choice.    


```r
lib.div <- diversities(ps1, index = "all")

lib.div2 <- richness(ps1)


# let us add library size
lib.div$LibrarySize <- sample_sums(ps1)

lib.div$Richness <- lib.div2$`0`

colnames(lib.div)
```
